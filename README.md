  Welcome to my repository dedicated to practicing problem-solving skills through HackerRank challenges. 
  Each file begins with a link 🔗 to the specific problem it addresses. 
  Please note that the code snippets here are primarily focused on solving the given problems and may not be optimized for real-world applications. ⚠️
